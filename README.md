# Layoffs Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes the "layoffs" dataset, providing insights into global layoff trends across various industries and companies. Using SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers key patterns and metrics related to layoffs, industry impact, and company performance.

## Dataset Information
- **File Name:** layoffs.csv
- **Source:** [Specify the source if applicable]
- **Description:** The dataset contains records of layoffs reported from different companies and industries worldwide. It captures crucial details such as company name, industry, total number of layoffs, date of layoffs, and geographical information.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `company`: Name of the company
  - `industry`: Sector or industry the company belongs to
  - `total_layoffs`: Number of employees laid off
  - `date`: Date the layoffs were reported
  - `location`: Geographical location of the company

## Project Goals
- Perform data cleaning and transformation to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Use advanced SQL techniques like JOINs, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.
- Visualize key insights and metrics through interactive dashboards (planned future step).

## SQL Concepts Applied
- **Basic Queries:** SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- **Joins:** INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
- **Aggregations:** COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- **Advanced Functions:** Window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Subqueries
- **Data Transformation:** CASE statements, string functions, and date functions

## Key Insights
- Trends in layoffs over time and across industries
- Companies with the highest and lowest layoff numbers
- Geographic distribution of layoffs
- Seasonal or periodic layoff patterns

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a SQL environment set up (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
3. Import the `layoffs.csv` dataset into your database.
4. Use the provided SQL scripts for data cleaning and analysis.

## Future Work
- Create interactive visualizations using Tableau or Power BI.
- Integrate additional datasets for deeper analysis.
- Build a dynamic dashboard to monitor real-time layoff data.
